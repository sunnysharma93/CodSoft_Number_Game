# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple Java program that implements a number guessing game. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has 5 attempts to guess the correct number.

## How the Game Works

- The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- The player is prompted to guess the number.
- After each guess, the program provides feedback:
  - If the guessed number is higher than the generated number, the program will notify that the number is lower.
  - If the guessed number is lower than the generated number, the program will notify that the number is higher.
  - If the guessed number matches the generated number, the player wins, and the game ends.
- The player has 5 attempts to guess the correct number. If the player fails to guess correctly after 5 attempts, the game ends, and the correct number is revealed.
